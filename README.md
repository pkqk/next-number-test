A coding test
=============

Please write a function in python which receives a natural decimal N-digit
number (0<N<15) as an input and returns the minimal next N-digit number with
the same sum of digits or -1 if there isn't one. Try not to use brute force.

Examples:
Input:          Output:
123             132
0200            1001
09999999999999  18999999999999
90              -1
9999            -1
